# Data Visualization: Movie Actor Connections
> Our goal for this project was to provide a visualisation of Movie Data in the form of the graph. 

## Task
1. Create a graph of the movie data, drawing connections based on shared actors.
2. Force Direct the graph created in Step 1.
3. Run KMeans algorithm on the graph created in Step 2.

## Materials/Credits
* Movie DataSet: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows)
* Force Directed Algorithm: [MikeBostok](https://gist.github.com/mbostock/4062045)
* KMeans Algorithm: [HugoJannson](https://github.com/nl-hugo/d3-kmeans)
